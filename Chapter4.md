# The Intelligent Investor: Chapter 4 
General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor

## Chapter
1. It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their investment funds. 
   1. The rate of return the investor can aim for is directly proportional to the risk they can take.
2. For the intelligent investor, however, the rate of return should only be dependent on the amount of intelligent effort they are willing and able to bear on his task.
3. The suggestion for a defensive investor's portfolio is a combination of high grade bonds and high grade stocks of a 25% - 75% range. 
   1. The advice, therefore, can boil down to 50-50 stock-bonds for the defensive investor to offset any risk but give a steady return.
4. __Bond Component__
   1. Two questions:
      1. __Should the bonds be tax-free or taxable?__
         1. There is evidence that a large proportion of investors will gain higher rates of return after municipal bonds than corporate bonds as municipal bonds are tax free.
         2. The current tax bracket of an individual must be considered hand-in-hand with bond yields.
      2. __Should the maturities be long term or short term?__
         1. This question boils down to:
            1. Does the investor want to assure himself against a decline in the price of bonds at a cost of:
               1. Lower annual yield
               2. Loss of possible appreciable gain in principal value.
   2. __Different types of bonds__
      1. US Saving Bonds, Series E And Series H
         1. US Saving bonds are considered the most safe.
         2. Series H bonds pay interest semi-annually. 
         3. Series E bonds don't pay out interest but accrues to the holder through increase in redemption value i.e. zero coupon bonds.
            1. Taxes paid either annually or not until the bond is disposed.
         4. No other investment guarantees:
            1. Absolute assurance of principal and interest payments.
            2. Right to demand full money back at any time.
            3. Tax benefits
      2. Other US Bonds
         1. Subject to federal interest taxes but free from state income taxes.
      3. Municipal and State Bonds
         1. Enjoy exemption from Federal income taxes.
         2. Ordinarily free of income tax in the state of issue and no where else.
      4. Corporate Bonds
         1. Subject to both state and federal taxes.
         2. Those investors in high income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield from good tax-free issues than from taxable ones. Trade-offs here have to be examined.
         3. Types of Corporate Bonds
            1. High Yielding Bonds
               1. By sacrificing quality, an investor can get a higher return from these bonds that don't have the same "protection" as the Treasuries.
               2. Long experience has demonstrated that the ordinary investor is to keep away from high yielding bonds because of exposure to too many risks:
                  1. Untoward developments
                  2. Disquieting price declines
                  3. Defaults
               3. This apprehension is now alleviated by the advent of Mutual Funds of high yield bonds that diversify the risk.
            2. Saving Deposits in Lieu of Bonds
               1. Like a first-grade bond of short maturity.
               2. Interest rates can fluctuate.
            3. Convertible Issues
            4. Call Provisions
               1. Investors are advised in long-term issues to sacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of non-callability i.e. the issuer cannot redeem the bond in any circumstance unlike callable bonds.
               2. Low coupon or low interest rate bonds have the advantage of non-callability and therefore, can be a safe investment.
5. __Other Stock Components__
   1. Preferred Stock
      1. The Preferred Stock lacks both the legal claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common shareholder (or partner).
         1. Preferred stock owners don't have the right to vote in shareholder meetings.
         2. They also carry no share in the company's profits beyond the fixed dividend rate albeit before any common dividend is paid out.
      2. Preferred Stock should only be bought by aggressive investors on a bargain basis or not at all or in other words in situations where the company is experiencing temporary adversity.
      3. These have better tax status for corporations vs. individual investors. 
   2. Security Forms
      1. Different variations on the same structure as Preferred Stock and Bonds can be found in other securities.
      2. For Income Bonds, interest doesn't have to be paid until it's earned by the company. Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earnings but the period is limited to 3 years.
         1. These should be used by corporations more than individuals.
         2. From an investor's standpoint, it is best for him in most cases:
            1. An unconditional right to receive interest payments.
            2. Right to other forms of protection than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid.

## Commentary
1. There are two ways to become an intelligent investor:
   1. __Defensive / Passive__: Creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).
   2. __Active / Aggressive__: Continually researching, selecting and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
2. The active approach is physically and mentally taxing while the defensive approach is emotionally demanding and requires ascetic detachment i.e. you have to say no to the allure of the latest and greatest things in the market. 
3. Both approaches are equally intelligent and you can be successful with either but if you know yourself well enough, stick with one method throughout the course of your investment lifetime.
   1. If you are highly competitive, think like a sports fan and relish an intellectual challenge choose Aggressive Investing.
   2. If you always feel rushed, crave similarity and don't relish thinking about money choose Defensive Investing.
4. Age has nothing to do with investments i.e. your allocation of portfolios shouldn't be a function of age going against conventional wisdom that you should invest according to your age. 
5. Traditional Rule of thumb is subtract your age from 100 and that'll be your allocation in stocks and rest in bonds or cash.
   1. This is dumb as tragedy can strike at any time if you are young and on the contrary, you could be getting a better return if you have the capital if you are older i.e. it is circumstantial and a function of the risk appetite of the investor.
6. Everyone should have some assets in the riskless haven of cash.
7. Because so many investors have the guts to cling on to stocks in a falling market, Graham insists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. 
8. Re-balancing your portfolio between bonds and stock allocations must be done in a patient and predictable schedule; the suggestion is once every 6 months on set days like 4th of July and New Years.
   1. The periodic re-balancing forces you to base your investing decisions on a simple, objective standard - Do I own more of this asset than my plan calls for? instead of guess work.
9.  Bond Selection
   1. Taxable / Tax Free
      1. Defer Taxable to 401k / Retirement accounts i.e. if you are outside the lowest tax bracket, you should buy only tax-free bonds outside of your retirement accounts.
   2. Long Term / Short Term
      1. Bonds and interest rates are on opposite ends of the see-saw 
         1. If interest rate rise, bond prices fall. Although, short term bonds fall far less than long term bonds.
         2. If interest rates fall, bond prices rise. Long term bonds will then outperform short term bonds.
      2. You can hedge your bets by buying intermediate bonds maturing in 5 - 10 years.
   3. Bond / Bond Fund
      1. Low cost of entry into Bond Fund since you need a minimum of $100k to invest as you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the risk.
      2. Better diversification.
      3. For most investors, bond funds beat individual bonds.
   4. Treasury Securities
      1. No credit risk as these are obligations from the government that are paid back sometimes by jacking up taxes.
      2. Cannot sell these to another investor.
   5. Saving Bonds
      1. Non-Marketable i.e. you cannot sell these to another investor.
      2. Forfeit 3 years of interest if you redeem these in less than 5 years.
10. Other Selection of Assets 
   1. Mortgage Securities
      1. Pooled together from thousands of mortgages, these bonds are issued by agencies like Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. 
      2. These aren't backed by US Treasuries i.e. there is credit risk associated with these are therefore, are compensated by a higher yield.
      3. Mortgage bonds generally underperform when interest falls and bomb when rates rise.
      4. Never buy individual mortgage bonds or CMOs from money hungry brokers.
   2. Annuities
      1. Insurance like investments enable you to defer current taxes and capture of stream of income after you retire.
      2. High cost annuities must be avoided like the plague for defensive investors.
   3. Preferred Stock
      1. Worst of both world type of investments i.e. less secure than bonds as they only have a secondary claim in case a company goes bankrupt and they offer less profit potential as these can be "called" back once situations improve.
      2. "If this company is healthy enough to deserve my investment, why is it paying a fat dividend on its preferred stock rather than issuing bonds _AND_ getting a tax break?"
         1. The company isn't healthy, the market for bonds is glutted.
         2. You should approach its preferred stock like unrefrigerated dead fish. 
   4. Common Stock
      1. No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for dividend income, would buy a stock for for its dividend income alone.
      2. The company and its businesses must be solid and its stock price must be reasonable.
