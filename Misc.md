4. __How do REITs hedge against inflation__: REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Real estate rents and values tend to increase when prices do. This supports REIT dividend growth and provides a reliable stream of income even during inflationary periods.
5. __Preferred Stock__: A main difference from common stock is that preferred come with no voting rights. In a liquidation, preferred stockholders have a greater claim to a company's assets and earnings. Preferred stock also gets priority over common stock, so if a company misses a dividend payment, it must first pay any arrears to preferred shareholders before paying out common shareholders.
