# The Intelligent Investor: Chapter 2
The Investor and Inflation

## Chapter
1. Shrinkage in the purchasing power of a dollar or worth of a dollar in the future compared to today is what investors should be cognizant of i.e. inflation.
2. Bonds are suspectible to inflation as they offer a fixed income and therefore stocks prove to be an obvious winner here. 
3. The expectation is that with stock investments, the dividend and price improvements offset the increase in inflation. 
4. There is a definite lack of certainty regarding the expectation mentioned in 3 i.e. it's not always a good idea to not have some amount of capital invested in only stocks or bonds but a combination of both.
5. JP Morgan was asked what will markets do next, he replied "They will fluctuate".
6. The intelligent investor avoids gold directly because of its high storage and investment costs and finds it better to find a well diversified mutual fund specializing in stocks of precious metal based companies. The advice here is to limit the stake to 2% of your total assets.
7. The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the unexpected and the disconcerting in this past of his life i.e. minimization of risk.
8. Investor should be cognizant of large scale inflation.
9. There is no close time connection between inflationary or deflationary conditions and the movement of common-stock earnings and prices. 

## Commentary
1. __Money Illusion__: Inflation is very real and eats away at wealth and uninvested cash. 
2. It is important to measure wealth not only by how much you make but also by how much you keep after inflation.
3. The intelligent investor must guard against whatever is unexpected and underestimated.
4. 2 Other Defenses Against Inflation vs. Just Stock
   1. __REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)__: Companies that own and collect rent from commercial and residential properties.
      1. Real Estate in this capacity is an almost fool-proof fighter against inflation.
   2. __TIPS (Treasure Inflation Protection Securities)__: Government Bonds whose value automatically goes up in value when inflation increases.
      1. Safe from Risk of Default as these are government bonds.
      2. Guarantee your value isn't offset by inflation as they prevent the erosion by going up in value.
      3. The catch here is that when the value of the TIPs goes up, the IRS recognizes it as taxable income.
         1. This implies TIPS are best for tax-deferred accounts like Roth and IRAs.
         2. Don't trade these as these can be volatile in the short run.
         3. 10% allocation of retirement fund keeps the money safe from the jaws of inflation.
   3. The one question never to ask a Bureaucrat is "Why?"
