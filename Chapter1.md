# The Intelligent Investor: Chapter 1 
Investment versus Speculation: Results to Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor.

## Chapter
1. An investment operation is one, which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and adequate return. 
   1. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
2. Wall Street has done a good job in adulterating the definition and contradistinction between speculating and gambling. 
3. Speculation is neither illegal, immoral, nor fattening to the pocketbook. Some speculation is necessary and unavoidable. Speculation should be intelligently executed. 
4. Unintelligent speculation comprises of:
   1. Speculating when you think you are investing. 
      1. Not being clear as to what you are doing can result in losses.
   2. Speculating seriously instead of as a pasttime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it. 
   3. Risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose. 
5. In conservative view, any non-professional who operates on a margin should recognize he / she is speculating.  
   1. Margin account lets you buy stocks with money you borrow from a brokerage firm. The collateral for the loan from the brokerage company is the value of the investments in your account.
6. Everyone who buys a so-called "hot" common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling.
7. Speculation can be a lot of fun and fascinating whilst you are ahead of the game and winning. 
   1. To try your luck, one should: 
      1. Put aside a portion, smaller the better, of your capital in a __separate__ fund for this purpose. 
      2. Never add more money to this account just because you are winning.
         1. As a matter of fact, that is the right time to get out.
      3. Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the __same account__ nor in any part of your thinking.
8. The future of security prices is __never__ predictable. Since you cannot predict the behavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own behavior. 
9. __Gordon Equation__: Stock Market's future return is the sum of the current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth.
10. Stocks aren't the best hedging tool against high inflation increases dictated by the consumer price index increases. To hedge against this increase, __Treasury Inflation Protected Securities__ (TIPS) were introduced for investors who expect inflation to increase. 
11. The investor cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or "hot" issues of any sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit. The contrary is true in the long run. 
12. Investors and Speculators can make money in the market through:
    1.  3 ways: 
        1.  Trading in the Market: "Buy low, sell dear"
        2.  Short Term Selectivity: Buying stocks for companies that are expected to report an increase in earnings in the near short term.
        3.  Long Term Selectivity: The emphasis that long term continued growth will persist in the future, as well.
    2.  There are negative connotations associated with all 3.
        1.  Stock Trading = Speculating.
        2.  Both Short and Long Term Selectivity are suspectible to 2 main problems:
            1.  __Human falliability__: Being straight up wrong about the conviction i.e. outright error in prediction.
            2.  __Nature of Competition__: If right, the markets would have already adjusted. 
    3.  The conclusion of the pitfalls is that to enjoy reasonable chance for continued better than average results, the investor must follow policies:
        1.  Inherently sound
        2.  Not Popular on Wall Street
13. __The Defensive Investor__
    1.  The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of __important__ companies with a __long__ record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition. 
        1.  Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such a list. 
    2. Three Supplementary Practices of the Intelligent Defensive Investor:
       1. Purchase of shares of well established investment funds as an alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio.
       2. Might utilize the one of the common-trust funds or commingled funds operated by trust companies and banks in many states or use the services of a recognized investment-counsel firm.
       3. __Dollar Cost Averaging__: Resulting in buying when the stock price is low than when it is high. This method is an application of broader approach called "Formula Investing".
    3. Stock and Bond portfolios where the investment of either should be between 25% and 75%.
14. __The Aggressive Investor__:
    1.  The aggressive investor is more enterprising than the defensive one and expects to attain better overall results, however, he must first make sure that his results will not be worse.
    2.  The enterprising investor must start with a clear conception as to which courses offer reasonable changes of success and which don't.
    3.  Buying a neglected and therefore, undervalued issue for profit generally proves a protracted patience-trying experience and is definitely one way to beat the average.
    4.  The cheap-anomalies that are undervalued that are the ones to look out for.

## Commentary
1. Brokers always make money when you trade whether you do or not.
2. By speculating by stock trading, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone else's.
3. Investment consists of three main elements:
   1. You must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying business before you buys its stock. 
   2. You must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses.
   3. You must aspire to "adequate", not extraordinary performance. 
4. Investor vs. Speculator
   1. An Investor calculates what a stock is worth based on the __value__ of the business. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price because somebody else will pay more for it. 
      1. Investors judge the market price by established standards of value.
      2. Speculators base their standards of value upon the market price.
   2. Quotational Value
      1. For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes is like oxygen; for an investor, "quotational value" matters much less. 
      2. Graham urges you to only invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price. "In other words, if there was no market for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on these terms?"
   3. Gambling Analogy
      1. Like casino / horserace gambling, speculating can be exciting but it's the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That's because Wall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds so that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who tries to beat the house at its own speculative game. 
      2. Investing is like partaking in a unique kind of casino - one where you cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only the rules that put the odds squarely in your favor. 
   4. People who invest make money for themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers. 
   5. Wall Street perennially downplays the durable virtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.
5. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be sustainably and reliably right. 
6. Wall Street made online trading sound like an instant way to mint money.
7. With the advent of online trading, stocks are becoming more decoupled from the companies that issued them - pure abstractions, just blips moving across a TV or computer screen. If the blips moved up, nothing else mattered.
8. A single half-baked opinion on price could double a company's stock even as its value went entirely unexamined. 
9. Speculative Formula are as trendy as before offering: "This is quick! This is easy! And it won't hurt a bit". 
10. "If you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge - if only by chance".
11. By random luck alone, companies that produce above-average stock returns will have plenty of things in common. But unless those factors __cause__ the stocks to outperform, they can't be used to predict future returns.
12. Stocks do well or poorly in the future because the businesses behind them do well or poorly - nothing more, and nothing less.
13. Graham's warning is that you must treat speculation as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:
    1.  You must never delude yourself into thinking that you're investing when you are speculating. 
    2.  Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin to take it seriously.
    3.  You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.
14. 10% seems the _max_ of overall wealth in the maximum permissible account with what's in your investment accounts; never allow your speculative thinking to spill over into your investing activities; and never put more than 10% of your assets into your "mad money" account, no matter what happens.
