# The Intelligent Investor: Introduction
Notes from the chapters and commentary.

## A Note About Benjamin Graham

1. A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that doesn't depend on its share price.
2. The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
3. The future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be. 
4. No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the __"Margin of Safety"__ - never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be - can you minimize your odds of error. 
5. The secret of your financial success is inside yourself. In the end your investments behave is much less important than how you behave. 

## Introduction: What This Book Expects to Accomplish 
### Chapter
1. Those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it: One should be forearmed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of bonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying conditions - some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one's own experience.
2. __Dollar Cost Averaging__: The principle of regular monthly purchases of strong common-stocks through thick and thin.  
3. __Technical Approaches__ buy when the price of the stock in the market has gone up and sell when the price of the stock of the price gone down through statistical methods. This goes against sound business sense anywhere else. 
4. Two main types of Investors:
   1. __Passive / Defensive__: This type of investor will place his / her chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes, or losses. The second aim would be to avoid making frequent decisions.
   2. __Active / Aggressive__: Willingness to devote time and care in selection of securities that are both sound and more attractive than the average. 
   Overtime, the active investor could benefit from higher rates of return, however, this is slowly decreasing. 
5. The de-facto view of investing is to choose industries that are the most likely to grow and then choose companies in these industries that show the most promise. 
   1. Two Moral Lessons from the Pitfalls of this view: 
      1. Obvious prospects of physical growth in business don't translate to prospects of growth in profits for the investor.
      2. Experts don't have dependable ways of selecting and concentrating on most popular industries and most popular companies.
6. The most probable enemy of an investor is himself / herself. 
7. The habit of relaying what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investing. Buy your stocks like you buy your groceries not like you buy your perfumes. 
8. The suggestion here is to not consider assets selling far above their __Tangible-Asset Value__.
   1. __Tangible Asset Value__:
      1. Included: 
         1. Physical Assets included such as: 
            1. Property

            3. Machines 
            4. Factories
            5. Equipment
            6. Inventory
      2. Financial Balances
         1. Cash
         2. Short-Term Investments
         3. Accounts Receivable: Money owed to a company by its debtors.
   2. Not Included:
      1. Brands
      2. Copyrights 
      3. Patents
      4. Franchises
      5. Goodwill: Extra capital when a buyer acquires a company.
      6. Trademarks
9. One aspect of investing is challenging is that the lay investor can get unremarkable results with little to no effort, however, the pitfall of trying to beat the average has a lot of active investors beat.
   1. If you merely try to bring just a little extra knowledge and cleaverness to bear upon your investment program, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you may well find that you have done worse.

### Commentary
1. No book can teach one to beat the market. Any that do proclaim are liars.
2.  Taking a foolish risk can put you so deep in the hole that it's virtually impossible to get out.
3.  No matter how careful you are, the prices of your investments will go down from time-to-time.
    1.  Risk cannot therefore, be eliminated but one can manage it and getting your fears under control.
4.  The "intelligent" part of "The Intelligent Investor" has nothing to do with IQ, however, it has to do with character.
    1.  For example, Newton let the roar of the crowd cost him $3M. 
5.  While enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.
6.  Dreadful losses always occur when the buyer forgets to ask "How much?".
7.  While it seems easy to foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. Once the industry is "obviously the best" to invest in, the stock prices will have already risen so high that the future returns have nowhere to go but down. 
8. The Intelligent Investor realizes that stocks become more risky, not less, as their prices rise - and less risky, not more, as their prices fall. 
   1. An Intelligent Investor dreads the bull market and welcomes the bear market.
   2. The decline in stock prices is a saner and safer time to be building wealth.
